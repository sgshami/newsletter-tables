            <p>
              SS Corporation will be releasing monthly newsletters about what
              the company is up to and interesting things you can do. This
              month, we will be focussing on astrophotography. Astrophotography
              is taking picutres of the night sky...duh. But why can't I just
              point my phone up in the sky and take a picture that looks like
              the one above? Read below to find out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most astrophotographers use regular DSLR or mirrorless cameras.
              But what if I told you that you can take that same picture with
              your phone. You just need to get a tripod for your phone as the
              phone needs to be held in the same spot for a few seconds
              (anywhere from 3 seconds to 45 seconods). This is the exposure and
              the exposure controls how long the shutter on your phone stays
              open. So the slightest movement can mess up the whole picture. But
              the night sky is moving! So if you choose an exposure time that is
              too long, you'll notice that the starts will come out as streaks
              as they have moved. A lot of professionals have telescoptes that
              "track" the sky so it moves with the start they are attempting to
              photograph.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that you have your epic image, you can see the general outline
              of the starts you attempted to take like the Milk Way Galaxy. It
              will not look like the photo above until you process the image. I
              personally use Adobe Lightroom but you can use Adobe Photoshop if
              you so choose. There are many tutuorials on YouTube on how you
              should go about editing the photos you took. You can go ahead and
              watch them just to see what the basic functions are. But no 2
              pictures are alike and each will require their own settings. So I
              found it best to just mess with all the settings and see which
              ones improve the picture and which don't. The setting I tweak the
              most is Exposure as that is what will really bring out all the
              light in the image and really show that Galaxy Shine :).
