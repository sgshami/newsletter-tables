Pros
	-Alternative text on all the images I used so that it can 
		render even if the images are not found
	-Very accessible friendly
  -You can read the text when anything happens to the page that does not alter the text
Cons
	-Contrast issue at the address that makes it hard to read.
		It is supposed to be more "hidden" so there is less focus
		on it.
	-I don't have any regions that are well defined. I kind of just
		have everything there all after eachother. Nothing kind of
		splitting it up.
  -It is hard to read the text when something happens to the text such as blurry vision
